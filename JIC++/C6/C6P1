Take the "menu program" you wrote earlier and break it out into a series of calls to functions for each of the menu items. Add the calculator and "99 Bottles of Beer" as two different functions that can be called.


#include <iostream>

void response_2() {

}

void response_3() {
	std::cout << "Your rice will be ready soon!\n" << std::endl;
}
